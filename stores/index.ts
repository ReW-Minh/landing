Most definitely of the jigsaw kind (picture proofs upon request üß©üòÑ), but also those that take us down rabbit holes for improved office efficiencies and technical difficulties troubleshooting. To a greater extent, each phase of the project management process is energizing from ideation to iteration with research, testing, and evaluation being where I particularly thrive. In particular, learning about colleagues‚Äô operational needs, orchestrating a solution, and then our growing excitement together as light bulb moments spur our next collaborations.
    
                I am blessed that my 20+ year career in international higher education has taken me around the world and provided me with invaluable opportunities to wear a kaleidoscope of hats. English teacher --> university lecturer --> consultant --> senior administrator --> service provider. Each step along the way continues to fuel my passion for lifelong learning and actively giving back to the Slater community.

                In 2016, I got the chance to work with Slate, a truly fantastic product. I wrote and maintain an open-source, RESTful integration between Slate and PowerCampus used by at least five institutions. I have extensive experience other areas as well, including Dynamic Forms by NG Web Solutions (a terrific, little-known product), Campus Caf√© (SIS), PowerFAIDS, AMAG Symmetry access control, Azure, VMWare, ShoreTel, etc. Your IT department will like working with ReWorkflow because we understand the demands on their time.

In 2008, I was a part of the little world village at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, Japan's first international university on top of a mountain. I then received a full scholarship to be an Eramus Mundus student in 2014. The Master in Research and Innovation in Higher Education allowed me to study in 4 countries during 2 years, and deepened my interest in international higher education.
    
                Upon moving to the US, I worked in admissions and admissions operations at Oklahoma City University and Columbia University. The experience working with prospective students front-end from my recruitment days has helped me tremendously when I moved to a more back-end roles, working with systems and processes to help student's application process more seamless. There are still a lot of questions: How to automatically load the student's enrollment history from their resume to their application in Slate? How to better communicate the official transcript submission instruction? The list goes on. These questions are the foundation of ReWorkflow. Jon & I started this adventure to help support institutions with streamlining their admissions and operations processes so the admission team can spend more time interacting with their students. Our ReWers work everyday towards building a more sustainable and evergreen system for teammate schools.`,
